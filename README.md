# Python

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description | Libraries |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |-------- |
| [Used Car Price Models](https://github.com/KarenSaraiMoralesMontiel/used_car_price_prediction_machine_learning)| Data Wrangling , EDA , Machine Learning | Focuses on developing a supervised learning model to estimate used car prices using the KaggleX Skill Assessment Challenge 2024 dataset. The goals include building both a classic linear regression model and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), evaluating the linear regression model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), and comparing the performance of the trained models.| matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn, pandas, scipy.stats, keras |
| [Black Jack Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/KarenSaraiMoralesMontiel/blackjack-montecarlo-app)| Data Wrangling , EDA , Simple Monte Carlo Simulation|A streamlit app provides a Monte Carlo simulation of the popular card game Blackjack. The simulation allows users to explore various aspects of the game, including the house's winning probability, distribution of game outcomes, and analysis of rounds where the house wins. | streamlit, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, pyecharts |
| [Proyecto Seguro](https://github.com/KarenSaraiMoralesMontiel/Proyecto-Seguro)| Data Wrangling , EDA , Machine Learning | This Streamlit application features a predictive model for medical expenses and data analysis for random generated data. Users can adjust parameters such as Coverage Type, Car Model, Car Year, Insured Value, Deductibles, and Insurance Status to generate medical expense predictions using a RandomForestClassifier.  | streamlit, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, pyecharts, echarts, scikit-learn, matplotlib_venn |
